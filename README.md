# CPU-First-MoMuGen-Engine
modular music generation engine. Unlike monolithic GPU-dependent models, this system utilizes a layered, iterative approach where instruments are generated as independent discrete token streams. The focus is on Real-Time Factor (RTF) targets, memory bandwidth optimization, and tiered cross-platform determinism.
